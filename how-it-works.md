### A quick introduction to the document theme
This is what a new Small Victories website looks like using the document theme. Drop markdown folders into your site folder.

### Settings
Your site’s settings are in a file called `settings.txt`. Anything you change here you can also change in your [admin page](http://www.smallvictories.com).

### Ordering
Files are shown in the order they appear in your site folder. You can reorder things simply by renaming them. For example, you can do something like:

- `document-1.md`
- `document-2.md`
- `document-3.md`

### Customizing your site
Your site has a `custom.css` and `custom.js` file. You can write your own styles or scripts in these files and Small Victories will automatically insert them in the right places.

Check out our [other themes](http://www.smallvictories.com) too.

For more information on customizing your site, there’s more info [here](http://www.smallvictories.com).
