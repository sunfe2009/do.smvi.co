# Your Small Victory

## Welcome to Small Victories
Make a website out of the contents of a Dropbox folder. No servers, no uploading, no CMS; just the tools you already have. Easily customizable and free.

### The document theme

This is what a new Small Victories website looks like using the document theme. Drop markdown files into your site folder and they will be converted into html pages.

You can find this file in your site folder, it’s called index.md.

The index.md file is automatically rendered at your sites root. All other markdown files are automatically added as links in the sidebar.
